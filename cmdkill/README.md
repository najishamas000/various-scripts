with this simple script you can kill all processes spawned by the same command by passing its name as an argument to cmdkill or however you choose to alias this script
for this to work you must create an alias in .bashrc and add the contents of this repo to your PATH
you will still have to run the 'ps' command to see which process is causing a problem
